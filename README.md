# **ProtPredictor**: Protein Function Prediction

**Abstract**: This code implements a machine learning pipeline for predicting protein functions using the CAFA-5 (Critical Assessment of Function Annotation) dataset. The pipeline first processes protein sequence data that has been pre-embedded using different models (T5, ProtBERT, and EMS2) to convert proteins into numerical vectors. It then trains neural networks (either a Multi-Layer Perceptron or 1D Convolutional Neural Network) to predict which Gene Ontology (GO) terms are associated with each protein, essentially predicting protein functions. The training process uses cross-entropy loss and monitors F1 score performance on both training and validation sets. Finally, it generates predictions for a test set and combines these predictions with other pre-existing predictions (from BlastP, Sprof, QuickGo, and DeepGoZero) through a merge operation, taking the best confidence scores available for each protein-GO term pair. This ensemble approach likely improves the overall prediction accuracy by leveraging multiple prediction methods.
